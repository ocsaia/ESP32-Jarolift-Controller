# v1.9.0-ocsaia.1

Fork of dewenni/ESP32-Jarolift-Controller, based on upstream v1.9.0. What this
fork changed, and which of it is verified on hardware, is in
IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md. The notes below are upstream's, for the release this fork
started from.

## what's new

### Service Commands

there is a new WebUI Page with service commands like:

- set shade
- set/delete upper end point
- set/delete lower end point

### remote signals (update)

The MQTT message for remote signals has been updated. The information about which shutter is controlled can be seen in the two variables `chBin` and `chDec`. `chBin` shows the used shutter as a 16-bit binary value, while `chDec` shows the same information as a decimal value for easier automation.

```json
topic:      ../status/remote/<serial-number>
payload:    {
              "name":   "<alias-name>", 
              "cmd":    "<UP, DOWN, STOP, SHADE>",
              "chBin":  "<channel-binary>",
              "chDec":  "<channel-decimal>"
            }
```
